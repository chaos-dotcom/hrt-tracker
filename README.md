# HRT Tracker

A self-hosted web application (that could have been a spreadsheet) to track hormone replacement therapy (HRT) data, including dosages, blood test results, and body measurements. Built with SvelteKit.

## Features

-   **Dosage Tracking:** Record historical doses and set up medication schedules for injectable estradiol, oral estradiol, antiandrogens, and progesterone.
-   **Blood Test Monitoring:** Log detailed blood test results, including levels for Estradiol, Testosterone, Progesterone, FSH, LH, Prolactin, and SHBG.
-   **Measurement History:** Keep track of physical changes with measurements for weight, height, bust, waist, hips, and more.
-   **Data Visualization:** View your hormone levels and dosage history on an interactive chart.
-   **Estrannaise Integration:** Generate a link to model your injectable estradiol regimen on [Estrannaise](https://estrannai.se/).
-   **Data Portability:** Easily back up your data to a JSON file and restore it when needed.
-   **Private:** Your data is stored in a local database (SQLite by default, Postgres-compatible via configuration), with JSON/YAML file backups kept on disk.
